# Image Classification with Deep Learning

---

## Overview

This project focuses on building a deep learning model for **image classification**. The goal is to categorize various objects and scenes within images, such as "sea," "tree," "street," or "bicycle," demonstrating the power of neural networks in visual recognition tasks.

---

## Key Features

* **Deep Learning Model:** Utilizes **Keras** (built on **TensorFlow**) to construct a Sequential neural network model for image classification.
* **Image Preprocessing:** Employs `cv2` (OpenCV) and `PIL` (Pillow) for efficient loading, resizing, and preparation of image data.
* **Data Exploration & Visualization:** Uses `matplotlib.pyplot` and `seaborn` for understanding image datasets and visualizing classification results.
* **Directory-Based Data Loading:** Organized to load image data efficiently from specified folder structures using `os` and `glob`.
* **Scalable Architecture:** Designed to be adaptable for different image datasets and classification challenges.

## Technologies & Libraries Used

* Python
* `pandas` (for data handling, if image metadata is involved)
* `numpy` (for numerical operations, especially with image arrays)
* `matplotlib.pyplot` (for plotting and visualization)
* `seaborn` (for enhanced statistical data visualization)
* `os` (for interacting with the operating system, e.g., directory traversal)
* `glob` (for finding pathnames matching a specified pattern, useful for image paths)
* `tensorflow` (backend for deep learning operations)
* `keras` (high-level API for building and training neural networks: `k.models.Sequential`)
* `cv2` (OpenCV - for image processing tasks)
* `PIL` (Pillow - Python Imaging Library for image manipulation)

## Project Structure

The project typically resides within a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) file, outlining the following key steps:

1.  **Library Imports & Setup:** Loading all necessary libraries.
2.  **Data Loading:** Efficiently loading images from organized directories.
3.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing sample images and understanding data distribution.
4.  **Image Preprocessing:** Resizing, normalizing pixel values, and preparing images for input to the neural network.
5.  **Model Definition:** Building the deep learning model architecture using `k.models.Sequential`.
6.  **Model Training:** Compiling and training the model on the prepared image dataset.
7.  **Model Evaluation:** Assessing the model's performance on unseen images using metrics like accuracy and loss.
8.  **Prediction & Visualization:** Demonstrating model predictions on new images and visualizing results.

## How to Run Locally

To get a copy of this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/Image-Classification-Deep-Learning.git](https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/Image-Classification-Deep-Learning.git)
    cd Image-Classification-Deep-Learning
    ```
    *(Remember to replace `YourGitHubUsername` with your actual GitHub username and adjust the repository name if it's different).*

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment.
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn tensorflow keras opencv-python pillow
    ```
    *(You might also need `ipykernel` to run the Jupyter Notebook: `pip install ipykernel`)*

3.  **Obtain the dataset:**
    A dataset of classified images (e.g., folders named "sea", "tree", "street", "bicycle" containing respective images) is required. Place your dataset in a structured manner within the project's root directory, or update the image loading paths in the Jupyter Notebook accordingly.

4.  **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    Open the project's `.ipynb` file (e.g., `Image_Classification_Notebook.ipynb`) and execute the cells sequentially.
